    <u><I><b>GLOBAL WARMING</b></I></u></br>

        <b>defination of global warming</b></br>
        Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system.
         It is a major aspect of climate change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements
         and by measurements of various effects of the warming. It is primarily caused by human activities such as
         burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which release greenhouse gases into the
        atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to an increase in global temperatures.
         The consequences of global warming include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, 
        \changes in ecosystems and wildlife habitats, and impacts on human health and agriculture.</br>

     <u><b>causes of global warming</b></u></br>
        The main causes of global warming are the increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily
        carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to
        a rise in global temperatures. The primary sources of these greenhouse gases include:</br>
        <u><b>burning of fossilfuels:</b></u>The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production and transportation
            is the largest source of CO2 emissions.</br>
        <u><b>Deforestation:</b></u>The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urban development reduces the number
            of trees that can absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.</br>
        <u><b>industrial processes:</b></u> Certain industrial activities, such as cement production and chemical manufacturing,
            release significant amounts of greenhouse gases.</br>
        <u><b>agriculture:</b></u> Livestock farming produces methane through enteric fermentation, and the use of synthetic 
        fertilizers releases nitrous oxide.</br>
       <u><b>Waste management</b></u> Landfills produce methane as organic waste decomposes anaerobically.</br>
    
        <u><I><b> Effects of global warming</b></I></u></br>
        The effects of global warming are wide-ranging and impact various aspects of the environment and human life.
            Some of the key effects include:</br>
        <u><b> Rising sea levels:</b></u> As global temperatures increase, polar ice caps and glaciers melt, leading to higher sea
            levels that threaten coastal communities.</br>
        <u><b>More frequent and severe weather events:</b></u> Global warming contributes to extreme weather events such as 
        hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall.</br>
        <u><b>change in ecosystems and wildlife habitats:</b></u> Many species are forced to migrate or face extinction due to 
        changing temperatures and altered habitats.</br>
        <u><b> Impactson agriculture:</b></u> Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect crop yields and food 
        security.</br>
       <u><b> Human health risks:</b></u>  Increased heat can lead to heat-related illnesses, while changes in climate can affect 
        the spread of diseases.</br>
